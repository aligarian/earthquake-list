Earthquakes of CA in last week
What i have done
1- Initialiased git, npm and install express, moment, request.
2- Filter the  response data using for loop (have not used becouse Array.filter - it's quite expensive in comparison of loop) and 
slice(have not used indexOf - it will read all text);
3- Sort using Quicksort Algo.
